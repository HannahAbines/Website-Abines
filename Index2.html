        </p><em>Hummus</em> is a delicious spread or dip made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon, and spices. It’s commonly eaten in the <strong>Middle East and the Mediterranean.</strong>
        Here in the United States, you can find store-bought versions at the grocery store, but we think you should skip those and make your own. <q>Let me show you how!</q>

                    <dt> Hummus Description:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Hummus is a smooth and creamy puree of cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini sesame paste and an acid, typically lemon juice.<img src="https://www.africanbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3505-1.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt=""> While hummus usually has garlic now, centuries ago it did not.
                        Olive oil isn’t a requirement either, but most modern recipes list it as an ingredient. Hummus has been a staple in the Middle East, Mediterranean and North African regions for longer than written records have been kept. 
                        Egypt is considered to be the birthplace of the earliest versions, and every variation is part of that family tree. The advent of a robust spice trade spread the high-protein dip around the globe because it's nexpensive and easy to make. 
                        The ingredients themselves have a long shelf life - long enough to sustain a ship’s crew until they could get food from a new port.
